## Introduction
In this project I want to visualize a dataset from the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience. This institute houses various research groups, all dedicated to 'master the mind'. The Alexander Heimel group studies the visual cortex of mice to reach a better understanding how vision works in humans, and how we can consciously observe the environment. 

The dataset I will visualize displays the activity of different neurons in the brain. Through an interactive design the goal is to playfully show people the basics of how we can observe.

## Visualisations
* Line graph of the activity of various brain regions over time
* Graph with different kinds of neurons displayed in one region (clicked in previous graph)
* Zoomed in activity of different types of neurons of one brain region over time (clicked in first graph)

Furthermore, information will be added about different experiments that were performed to obtain the displayed data.
