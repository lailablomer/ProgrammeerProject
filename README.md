## Introduction
New idea: visualizing green house gases (GHG) emissions over time, worldwide. A D3 datamap will show the world, coloured by GHG emissions in 2012. Clicking on a country will show you various GHG like carbondioxide and methane, in a pie chart for that country. Also, a line graph will show the GHG emissions over time. Lastly, a pop-up on the worldmap will inform the user about the exact GHG values, that countries GDP and the population. 

## Visualisations
* Worldmap with GHG emissions
* Piechart with GHG emissions for a country
* Linegraph with GHG emissions over time

## Programming
All visualisations will be D3.js, so most of the code will be JavaScript.
